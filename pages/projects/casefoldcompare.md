# Casefold Compare Utility Script

[Source](https://github.com/erhkim/Casefold-Data-Compare)

Created while as a Data Analyst, I wanted to create a script that would compare two data sets and return a summary of the differences, intersections, unique values case insensitively across multiple different languages, hence why I used Python's casefold algorithm instead of the standard way to do it with lower -> upper case conversion.
